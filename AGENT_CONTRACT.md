# Agent Contract

## Purpose
This contract documents working agreements for implementing HeardDat.

## Commitments
- Maintain a clear, incremental build plan with checkboxes.
- Favor working code and verifiable behavior over documentation-only changes.
- Add human-readable comments in code paths that handle audio routing, pairing, and security.
- Keep security and privacy considerations documented alongside implementation.
- Avoid committing binary artifacts.

## Deliverables
- PC server, Android client, Chrome extension, and Firefox extension.
- Shared protocol documentation and tests.

## Quality Bar
- Each phase should be testable with scripted steps or automated tests.
- Audio streaming should be resilient to IP changes and reconnection events.
